# use-oop-state
This package aims to solve the problems of complex states in React's functional components. While functional programming in React has many perks, managing a complex state can get messy. This package combines the perks of object-oriented programming with React's functional programming to make it easier to split up code and responsibility among classes, making it easier to create and maintain clean code.
