# use-oo-state
> While functional programming in React has many perks, managing a complex state can get messy. This package aims to solve the problems of complex states in React's functional components. Combining the many benefits of object-oriented programming with React's functional programming makes splitting up code and responsibility among classes easier. This makes it easier to create and maintain clean code.
